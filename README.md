Want to track your robot accurately, but lack LiDAR? Fret not, we have our  Optical Localisation Robotics (OLR)

By using a camera to scan the AR Code around the area, the system determines the playfield area.

By tracking the bearings of robot we are able to determine the movement required for the robot to reached its destination
